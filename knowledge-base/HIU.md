HiU's Proof of Engagement (PoE) game enables human interaction as a reward mechanism for app/website use. Users accumulate points through ping-pong game, exchangeable for rewards or functions. Non-linear scoring incentivizes quick responses, and game stops if no response in set time.

HiU facilitates interactions between humans

The HiU token would essentially be a digital representation of the value generated by users participating in the game. The token would serve as a reward for engagement within the game and could be redeemed for interactions with humans or other services.
