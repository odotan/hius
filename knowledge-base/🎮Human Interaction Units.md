Social Impact, Ethereum Future

- transparency and accountability in the distribution of rewards

---
Users accumulate points through interactions, using the Ethereum blockchain as an underlying mechanism. This game aims to incentivize user engagement on a platform and potentially open up new possibilities for Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency space.

The game's process involves users sending and receiving messages by tapping the "HiU" button, and a reward system for generating Human interaction Units.

Here's an outline of the steps involved in the game:
1. Users launch the game by finding a partner or group to play with and tapping the "HiU" button.
2. The app creates a message containing various data, such as public keys, block hashes, and prior message hashes.
3. This message is encrypted and broadcast on the network.
4. A valid nonce (random-generated number) and hash are determined and then shared across the network.
5. Recipients validate the information and decrypt messages belonging to their public key while disregarding unrelated messages.
6. Points are accumulated based on the number of Ethereum blocks since the initial message.
7. The game continues as users keep interacting with the "HiU" button and exchanging messages.
