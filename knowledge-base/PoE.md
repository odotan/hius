A PoE (Proof of Engagement) algorithm is a theoretical concept that focuses on measuring, verifying, and rewarding user engagement within a system or platform. The purpose of this algorithm is to encourage active participation and maintain a sustainable community in the context of applications or platforms, particularly in decentralized environments like blockchain networks.

A PoE algorithm would typically include the following components:

1. Measurement: The algorithm assesses various user engagement metrics, such as interaction frequency, duration, quality, and contributions to the platform (e.g., content creation or valuable feedback).

2. Verification: PoE confirms the authenticity of user interactions, ensuring that the engagement is genuine and not manipulated through illicit means (e.g., bots or spamming).

3. Rewards: Based on engagement levels, the algorithm may allocate rewards or incentives to users, often in the form of tokens or other digital assets. This promotes active participation and helps retain a strong community.

A PoE algorithm, when designed and implemented effectively, can uphold the integrity of a platform or system, ensuring that user engagement is genuine and valuable. This concept can be applied to various domains, from social networks to decentralized applications (dApps) built on blockchain networks such as Ethereum.

The process begins when a user initiates a game by selecting a participant or group and tapping a "Human interaction Unit" (HiU) button. This creates a message containing various data, including public keys, payload, salt, and Ethereum block information. The message is encrypted and combined with a nonce, then run through a hashing algorithm until a valid hash is found.

The encrypted message, nonce, and valid hash are broadcast over the network. Nodes listen for these broadcasts and save valid messages. When the recipient comes online, they validate and decrypt the messages meant for them. The recipient can then respond by tapping their HiU button, repeating the process and adding points to the sender's score.

Group games and non-linear scoring can add variety to the experience, incentivizing faster responses and increased engagement. To prevent cheating through the use of bots, measures such as captchas, limiting the number of games per user, introducing random elements in the scoring algorithm, and tracking user behavior can be implemented.
