- bubblewrap-inspired game, you have to pop in sequence according to instructions on a friends device

We can use a zero knowledge proof protocol to verify that the player has successfully completed each step of the game. The player would generate a proof for each step they complete and send it to their friend's device for verification. 

This way, even if someone tries to brute force their way through the game by guessing each step, they would still need to generate a valid proof for each step in order to progress. This adds an extra layer of security and makes it much more difficult to cheat.
